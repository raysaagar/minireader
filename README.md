Mobile MiniReader
==========

### A Mobile Web-Based Reader

This project was designed after numerous years of reading The Straight Dope website on my iPhone. There is no mobile version, so I decided to scrap the data and make my own viewer. 

There are 3 themes built-in for your viewing pleasure (Light, Gray, Dark).

### Websites Supported
